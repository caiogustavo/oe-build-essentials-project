Simple meta-package to install the OE requirements for OpenEmbedded 
development on an Ubuntu workstation.

You can use the .deb directly or grab the whole project, modify
the DEBIAN/control file and then rebuild the .deb file yourself
with your own customizations.

If you are customizing, then run the following command to build
a new package.

$ cd oe-build-essentials-project
$ dpkg-deb -b oe-build-essentials

To install the oe-build-essentials.deb run the following:

$ sudo dpkg -i oe-build-essentials.deb
$ sudo apt-get -f install

The apt-get call does the real installation and will give you a
list of what's going to happen and a chance to abort.


The default packages are directly from the Gumstix developer site
http://www.gumstix.net the Setup and Programming link for Overos.
It works for Beagleboards.

Here's the package list
git-core
git-doc
subversion
build-essential
help2man
diffstat
texi2html
texinfo
libncurses5-dev
cvs
gawk
python-dev
python-pysqlite2
unzip
chrpath
ccache
sgmlspl

I added sgmlspl because of a temporary recipe dependency problem.

I also added ckermit as a RECOMMENDS because that's what I use.
